# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature encompasses the final steps needed to prepare the audiobook wishlist manager for production deployment and improved user experience. It includes setting up Railway deployment, creating a GitHub repository, implementing default sorting by book name, and adding a dedicated home screen that displays only the next books to read.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to deploy the application to Railway, so that users can access the application online.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment process is initiated THEN the system SHALL successfully deploy to Railway platform
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL be accessible via a public URL
3. WHEN users access the deployed application THEN all functionality SHALL work as expected in the production environment
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to create a new GitHub repository and push the project code, so that the code is version controlled and publicly available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new GitHub repository is created THEN the system SHALL contain all project files
2. WHEN the code is pushed to GitHub THEN all commit history SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN the repository is created THEN it SHALL include appropriate README and documentation
4. WHEN the repository is public THEN other developers SHALL be able to clone and contribute to the project

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want books to be sorted by name by default, so that I can easily find books in alphabetical order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the book list loads THEN books SHALL be displayed in alphabetical order by title
2. WHEN new books are added THEN they SHALL automatically appear in the correct alphabetical position
3. WHEN users apply other sorting options THEN they SHALL override the default name sorting
4. WHEN users clear sorting filters THEN the system SHALL return to alphabetical sorting by name

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dedicated home screen that shows only my next books to read, so that I can quickly see what I should read next without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the home screen THEN the system SHALL display only books marked as "next to read"
2. WHEN no books are marked as next to read THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
3. WHEN users want to see all books THEN they SHALL be able to navigate to the full book list
4. WHEN the home screen loads THEN it SHALL load faster than the full book list by showing fewer items
5. WHEN users mark or unmark books as "next to read" THEN the home screen SHALL update accordingly
