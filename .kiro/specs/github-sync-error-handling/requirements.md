# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub sync functionality in the audiobook wishlist manager is currently failing silently without providing adequate error feedback to users. When data saving to GitHub fails, users are not informed of the specific issues, making it difficult to troubleshoot and resolve sync problems. This feature will improve error handling, logging, and user feedback for GitHub sync operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear error messages when GitHub sync fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GitHub sync operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error notification with specific details about the failure
2. WHEN a sync error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the technical error details for debugging purposes
3. WHEN multiple sync attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on potential solutions
4. WHEN a network error occurs during sync THEN the system SHALL distinguish it from authentication or permission errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed sync status information, so that I can monitor the health of my data synchronization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the application THEN the system SHALL display the current sync status with clear visual indicators
2. WHEN a sync is in progress THEN the system SHALL show progress feedback to the user
3. WHEN the last sync occurred THEN the system SHALL display the timestamp of the last successful sync
4. WHEN sync errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain a count of recent failures and display warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error logging for GitHub sync operations, so that I can diagnose and fix sync issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any GitHub API call fails THEN the system SHALL log the HTTP status code, response body, and request details
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log specific authentication error details
3. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL log rate limit information and retry timing
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL log network-specific error details with timestamps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually retry failed sync operations, so that I can resolve temporary sync issues without losing my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sync operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide a "Retry Sync" button or option
2. WHEN I click retry THEN the system SHALL attempt the sync operation again with fresh error handling
3. WHEN retrying after authentication errors THEN the system SHALL guide me to check my GitHub token
4. WHEN retrying after network errors THEN the system SHALL wait an appropriate interval before attempting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI to automatically update when sync operations retrieve newer data from GitHub, so that I can see the most current version of my wishlist.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sync operation returns updated data from GitHub THEN the system SHALL update the displayed book list with the new data
2. WHEN remote data is newer than local data THEN the system SHALL refresh the UI to show the remote books
3. WHEN a full sync completes successfully THEN the system SHALL check if the returned data differs from the current UI state and update accordingly
4. WHEN sync data contains book changes THEN the system SHALL update the books array to reflect the synced state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export error logs, so that I can share diagnostic information when seeking support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the settings or debug section THEN the system SHALL provide an option to export error logs
2. WHEN I export logs THEN the system SHALL include sync-related errors with timestamps and context
3. WHEN exporting logs THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive information like tokens while preserving diagnostic value
4. WHEN no errors exist THEN the system SHALL inform me that no error logs are available for export
