# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current audiobook wishlist manager uses GitHub Gist for data synchronization, which has become complex with conflict resolution, merging logic, and reliability issues. This feature will migrate the application to use a proper database backend with a REST API, providing better data consistency, real-time sync, and multi-device support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my audiobook data stored in a reliable database, so that I don't have to worry about sync conflicts or data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add, update, or delete books THEN the system SHALL store the changes directly in a database
2. WHEN I access the application THEN the system SHALL load data from the database in real-time
3. WHEN multiple devices make changes THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates without conflicts
4. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless multi-device synchronization, so that changes on one device immediately appear on all my other devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make changes on one device THEN other devices SHALL see the updates immediately without manual sync
2. WHEN I add a book on my phone THEN it SHALL appear on my laptop automatically
3. WHEN I'm offline THEN the system SHALL queue changes and sync when connection is restored
4. WHEN multiple devices are online THEN they SHALL all show the same current data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple REST API for the audiobook data, so that the frontend can perform standard CRUD operations without complex sync logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs to create a book THEN it SHALL make a POST request to the API
2. WHEN the frontend needs to read books THEN it SHALL make a GET request to the API
3. WHEN the frontend needs to update a book THEN it SHALL make a PUT request to the API
4. WHEN the frontend needs to delete a book THEN it SHALL make a DELETE request to the API

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my existing GitHub gist data migrated to the new database, so that I don't lose my current wishlist.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration runs THEN the system SHALL import all books from the existing GitHub gist
2. WHEN importing books THEN the system SHALL preserve all book data including tags, ratings, and metadata
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify all books were imported correctly
4. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work offline with local caching, so that I can view and modify my wishlist even without internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm offline THEN the system SHALL show my cached book data
2. WHEN I make changes offline THEN the system SHALL store them locally
3. WHEN I come back online THEN the system SHALL sync all offline changes to the database
4. WHEN offline changes conflict with server data THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully
